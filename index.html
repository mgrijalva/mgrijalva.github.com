<p>This is my personal page for my personal projects and other fun stuff I'm working on.</p>
<p>
My name is Michael Grijalva, and I am currently a student at UCSC
working towards a B.S. in computer science. This website is a just a little repository for
my various personal and school projects that I feel are worth posting about. You'll find them 
on the Projects page.
<br/><br/>
Check it out, see what you find, and hopefully it's something interesting.

<h1 class="projectSection">What I'm currently up to</h1>
<p>
I'm currently advancing my knowledge of game programming. It's exciting to apply the things I 
learned about linked lists and such to real-world programs. You can see the current program I'm
messing around with on my github: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mgrijalva/Simple_Allegro_Game">Click here</a>
<br/><br/>
My other current interest is the Box2D physics library. It's awkward to get used to, but it's
extremely fun once you get the hang of it. Best of all it can be used with any game engine since all it does is crunch numbers.
Give Box2D your objects, forces, etc. and it spits back their positions, angles, etc. Awesome.

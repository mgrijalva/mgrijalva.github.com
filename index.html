<p>This is my personal page for my personal projects and other random stuff I'm working on.</p>
<p>
My name is Michael Grijalva, and I am currently a student at UCSC
working towards a B.A. in computer science. This website is a just a little repository for
my various personal and school projects that I feel are worth posting about. You'll find them 
on the Projects page.
<br/><br/>
Check it out, see what you find, and hopefully it's something interesting.
</p>
<h1 class="projectSection">What I'm currently up to</h1>
<p>Current working on:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Another game in SFML. "Collect the gems". <a href="http://youtu.be/0fNDecFzwSg">Quick video</a> 
   - <a href="https://github.com/mgrijalva/Collect_the_gems">Github page</a></li>
   <li>Converting a car maintenance tracker from C to C# (with a GUI). <a href="projects.html#carTracker">See it</a></li>
   <li>A machine learning course from Stanford (via Coursera.org). <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml">Check it out</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
I'm currently working with SFML and Box2D physics in my spare time. My first little 'game' was Avoid the Balls which can be seen 
on the projects page (Box2D wasn't used in this game). Box2D is confusing to get used to, but it's amazingly powerful when you
get it down.
</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>
Also I'm taking an intro to graphics course (<a href="https://www.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS184.1x/2013_Spring/info">CS184.1x</a>)
from edx.org. The course is derived straight from the course at Berkeley. Edx is great by the way. The courses have homework, labs,
etc. so it's like you're taking an actual online course. Best of all it is free!
<br/><br/>
I've just finished the third homework. It took a lot of fiddling around to get it right. This is a quick video of the program:
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3LCpCgbvEc&feature=youtu.be">YouTube</a> <br/>
Setting up the correct matrix multiplication order (for transformations) was tricky as was learning how to setup the shaders. I see how insanely complicated a simple graphics program is now, and I'm just getting started. Up next is a raytracer!

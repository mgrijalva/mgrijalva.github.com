         A small game made with SFML. This game is timed. You collect the yellow gems (they add 1 second to the clock), and you avoid the red balls
         as they subtract 1 second from the clock. Survive for as long as you can.
         <br/><br/>
         This game is currently a work in progress. It is close to being finished though.

Layered is a platform game that also involves your memory. You will be charged with the task 
of memorizing the location of three differently colored platforms. Each block 
corresponds to a layer. Red for layer 1, green for 2, blue 3. You can only land on a red 
block when you're on layer 1,etc.. When you start the level all the blocks will become black. 
You must then navigate your way to the finish while collecting all of the yellow/black gems in the level.

This is a program that was assigned as part of my abstract data types class. The initial
program (which was provided) predicts when balls will collide. It finds the minimum time
and then animates them until that collision occurs. This way all the collisions need not
be checked every step (which would be sloooooow). The collision times were maintained in
a 2D array, and the running time was O(n^2) as a result.</br>
My task: </br>
   Replace the array with a min-heap. With the min-heap the run time can be brought down
   to O(nlogn). With 2000 balls there was a 142% increase in framerate and a 58% decrease
   in execution time. Not too shabby.
</br></br>
Run the program via command line: "Program2.jar XXX" where XXX is either the number of
balls to randomly generate, or a file with info about balls (samples provided)

This program is run via a UNIX command line. Run "gameoflife [FILE]" where FILE contains info
about the creature to simulate. Some samples are included.
<br/><br/>
This program simulates the classic game of life. It prints a before and after picture containing the
creature after the requested number of generations.
<br/><br/>
One issue with the game of life is how to count the neighbors efficiently. One could simply scan the entire array, count the neighbors, kill/create the appropriate cells, and be done. This is horribly (O(n^2)) inefficient though. The implementation in this program uses an un-initialized array. 
<br/><br/>
The live cells are placed into an empty array separate from the main board. For each generation the program looks at this array, finds the neighboring cells, counts the live neighbors for each one, kills/creates cells, adds the new live cells to the array, and removes the dead cells. Using this method only the live cells need to be checked for each generation. This brings the running time down to O(n), where n is the number of live cells.

<p class="projectText">
The rules of the game are so: You must take a match and jump two matches to cross it with another. The goal is to end up with all the matches crossed. A video of the game can be seen here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsT2yWqRPf0">YouTube video</a>
<br/><br/>
The program is run like any other Python program. i.e. “python Program3.py [FILE]” where FILE contains the configuration of sticks. The first line specifies how many. In the next line a 0 means uncrossed, and a 1 means two matchsticks crossed. The program will solve it and spit out a solution (in backwards order).
<br/><br/>
Memoization is used to increase the solving speed. With memoization the same situation need not be solved over and over. A recursive solution was used first then hashing was used to introduce memoization. The memoized version of the program solved the board around 17 times faster. With 14 sticks the solve() function (the one that actually solves the board) is only called 1214 times with memoization vs 9788 times with the recursive solution. More of this info can be seen in the README file.

This is a command-line program for a faux car rental company. You can enter invoices and keep track of profits.
This program was built as part of a C++ class I took. The program was built in sections as we went
through the class learning different object-oriented concepts. 
<br/>
Sure, it's just homework for a class, but
it's an application that actually does something useful.

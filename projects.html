                     The AI uses the Monte Carlo method. While the method itself seems rather stupid, the results are surprisingly intelligent. The AI
                     is tough to beat. The AI works best on board sizes of around 5 to 11. 11 is the standard size for Hex.

                     This game was initially written for a class, but I wasn't happy with its performance. I re-wrote it from scratch to
					 increase performance by fixing design issues (I used pointers way too much) and adding C++11 threading.

         This is a program that was assigned as part of my abstract data types class. The initial

         and then animates them until that collision occurs. This way all the collisions need not
         be checked every step (which would be sloooooow). The collision times were maintained in
         a 2D array, and the running time was O(n^2) as a result.</br>
         My task: </br>
            Replace the array with a min-heap. With the min-heap the run time can be brought down
            to O(nlogn). With 2000 balls there was a 142% increase in framerate and a 58% decrease
            in execution time. Not too shabby.

         <br/><br/>
         This program simulates the classic game of life. It prints a before and after picture containing the
         creature after the requested number of generations.
         <br/><br/>
         One issue with the game of life is how to count the neighbours efficiently. One could simply scan the entire array, count the neighbours, kill/create the appropriate cells, and be done. This is horribly (O(n^2)) inefficient though. The implementation in this program uses an un-initialized array. 
         <br/><br/>
         The live cells are placed into an empty array separate from the main board. For each generation the program looks at this array, finds the neighbouring cells, counts the live neighbours for each one, kills/creates cells, adds the new live cells to the array, and removes the dead cells. Using this method only the live cells need to be checked for each generation. This brings the running time down to O(n), where n is the number of live cells.

         The rules of the game are so: You must take a match and jump two matches to cross it with another. The goal is to end up with all the matches crossed. A video of the game can be seen here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsT2yWqRPf0">YouTube video</a>
         <br/><br/>
         The program is run like any other Python program. i.e. “python Program3.py [FILE]” where FILE contains the configuration of sticks. The first line specifies how many. In the next line a 0 means uncrossed, and a 1 means two matchsticks crossed. The program will solve it and spit out a solution (in backwards order).
         <br/><br/>
         Hashing is used to increase the solving speed. With hashing (memoization) the same situation need not be solved over and over. A recursive solution was used first, and then hashing was used to introduce memoization. The new version of the program solved most game sizes around 17 times faster. With 20 sticks the game is solved in around 0.47 seconds with hashing and 143 seconds without. More of this info can be seen in the README file.

A small game made with SFML and OpenGL.
This game was created as a simple example of a game loop in SFML. It also demonstrates the use of a generic GameObject
class and how polymorphism is used in a game.

This is a game where you guide a little ball through various levels collecting gems. It was designed
as a casual game to chill out to.
<br/><br/>
The game was never officially 'finished'. Right now it's version 0.42. Made with Game Maker.

Layered is a platform game that also involves your memory. You will be charged with the task 
of memorizing the location of three differently colored platforms. Each block 
corresponds to a layer. Red for layer 1, green for 2, blue 3. You can only land on a red 
block when you're on layer 1,etc.. When you start the level all the blocks will become black. 
You must then navigate your way to the finish while collecting all of the yellow/black gems in the level.
<br/><br/>
Made with Game Maker.

This is a program that was assigned as part of my abstract data types class. The initial
program (which was provided) predicts when balls will collide. It finds the minimum time
and then animates them until that collision occurs. This way all the collisions need not
be checked every step (which would be sloooooow). The collision times we're maintained in
a 2D array, and the running time was O(n^2) as a result.</br>
My task: </br>
   Replace the array with a min-heap. With the min-heap the run time can be brought down
   to O(nlogn). With 2000 balls there was a 142% increase in framerate and a 58% decrease
   in execution time. Not too shabby.
</br></br>
Run the program via command line: "Program2.jar XXX" where XXX is either the number of
balls to randomly generate, or a file with info about balls (samples provided)

This little command line program keeps track of your car maintenace. It's
something I built because I was tired of writing down, erasing, and losing the piece of
paper with all my maintenance checks.<br/><br/>
When you first start the program it'll ask you to log the last time you performed each task.
It will also bug you that the 'intervals' file doesn't exist, it'll make the file for you.

This is a DOS program for a faux car rental company. You can enter invoices and keep track of profits.
This program was built as part of a C++ class I took. The program was built in sections as we went
through the class learning different object-oriented concepts. 
<br/>
Sure, it's just homework for a class, but
it's an application that actually does something useful.

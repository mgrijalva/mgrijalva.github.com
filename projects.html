										This was a team project for a software engineering course. Over the course of ten weeks we designed a game engine for creating choose-your-own-adventure type games. Games are scripted via xml files. You can integrate images, music, and sounds into your game. It is also possible to define and modify variables as a player plays your game. Conditional (if and else) statements are supported so that you can control the flow of your game. 
										<br/><br/>
										The download link contains a sample game as well as the user manual.

										<br/><br/>
										Requires .NET framework to run. 
										<br/><br/>
										This program was orginally written in C, but it has been converted to C# with a GUI.

										This is a program of the board game Hex . The white player plays from the top to the bottom, and the black player plays from left to right. Each player tries to form a pathway across the board. 
										<br/><br/>
										The AI uses the Monte Carlo method. While the method itself seems rather stupid, the results are surprisingly intelligent. The AI is tough to beat. The AI works best on board sizes of around 5 to 11. 11 is the standard size for Hex. 
										<br/><br/>
										This game was initially written for a class, but I wasn't happy with its performance. I re-wrote it from scratch to increase performance by fixing design issues (I used pointers way too much) and adding C++11 threading. 
										<br/><br/>
										NOTE: You can easily compile a Unix version with the Makefile on the Github page. The above download link contains a Windows version.

									<p>
										This program is run via a UNIX command line. Run "gameoflife [FILE]" where FILE contains info about the creature to simulate. Some samples are included. 
										<br/><br/>
										This program simulates the classic game of life. It prints a before and after picture containing the creature after the requested number of generations. 
										<br/><br/>
										One issue with the game of life is how to count the neighbours efficiently. One could simply scan the entire array, count the neighbours, kill/create the appropriate cells, and be done. This is horribly (O(n^2)) inefficient though. The implementation in this program uses an un-initialized array. 
										<br/><br/>
										The live cells are placed into an empty array separate from the main board. For each generation the program looks at this array, finds the neighbouring cells, counts the live neighbours for each one, kills/creates cells, adds the new live cells to the array, and removes the dead cells. Using this method only the live cells need to be checked for each generation. This brings the running time down to O(n), where n is the number of live cells.

										The rules of the game are so: You must take a match and jump two matches to cross it with another. The goal is to end up with all the matches crossed. A video of the game can be seen here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsT2yWqRPf0">YouTube video</a>
										<br/><br/>
										The program is run like any other Python program. i.e. “python Program3.py [FILE]” where FILE contains the configuration of sticks. The first line specifies how many. In the next line a 0 means uncrossed, and a 1 means two matchsticks crossed. The program will solve it and spit out a solution (in backwards order). 
										<br/><br/>
										Hashing is used to increase the solving speed. With hashing (memoization) the same situation need not be solved over and over. A recursive solution was used first, and then hashing was used to introduce memoization. The new version of the program solved most game sizes around 17 times faster. With 20 sticks the game is solved in around 0.47 seconds with hashing and 143 seconds without. More of this info can be seen in the README file.
